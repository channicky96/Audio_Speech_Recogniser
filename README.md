# Audio_Speech_Recogniser

Programmed in MATLAB

Speech recognition is the ability of a program to identify words and phrases in spoken
language and convert them into a machine-readable format. This then enables the program to
construct a prediction using various models of speech to compute the set of words spoken in an
unknown speech file. This system uses a set of twenty names and train it to
predict which of these names were being spoken in an unknown speech file.
